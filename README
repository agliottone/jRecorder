This is a fork of https://github.com/sythoos/jRecorder

The recorded file is passed to server with the html form multipart/form-data in POST.

For this, the function of sendData is not recallable from javascript.
Users should click on button in flash

Reasons:

...
In Flash Player 10 and later, if you use a multipart Content-Type (for example "multipart/form-data") that contains an upload (indicated by a "filename" parameter in a "content-disposition" header within the POST body), the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to uploads:

    The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated action, such as a mouse click or key press.
    If the POST operation is cross-domain (the POST target is not on the same server as the SWF file that is sending the POST request), the target server must provide a URL policy file that permits cross-domain access.

Also, for any multipart Content-Type, the syntax must be valid (according to the RFC2046 standards). If the syntax appears to be invalid, the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to uploads.

For send file and generic post data, I use UploadPostHelper

You must have Flash cs5.5+ and compile the source

Flash make a ajax request.

1.Make your form and write js function to get value of input and function for validation in jRecorder.js

	$.jRecorder.get_name = function(){
		return jQuery("input[name='name']").val()
		
	}

				
	$.jRecorder.callback_validateform = function(){

		if ((jQuery("input[name='nome']").val()=='') || (jQuery("input[name='cognome']").val()=='')){
			return false;
			}else{
				return true
		}

in Main.as write
in finalize_recording() function

var input_name:String = ExternalInterface.call("$.jRecorder.get_name");

var postVariables:Object = {name:input_name}

and

urlRequest.data = UploadPostHelper.getPostData( 'hello.wav', recorder.output,postVariables);
hello.wav is name of file, change this

Compilate the fla file in swf.
